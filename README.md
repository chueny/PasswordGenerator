# PasswordGenerator
An application that generates strong random password based on user criterias

This project creates an application that randomly generates a secure password given specific criterias.  User selects specific criterias  and the application meets those criterias, such as length, special character, lower or upper cases. If user's criterias are met, a random password is generated.
